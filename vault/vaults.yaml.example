# Inflectiv Vault Agent Configuration
# Connect your agent to personal + knowledge vaults
# Usage: VAULTS_CONFIG=/path/to/vaults.yaml uvicorn vault_server:app --port 8766

personal:
  # Personal vault runs as your local vault_server instance
  url: http://localhost:8766
  token: vtok_YOUR_OWNER_TOKEN   # printed on first startup

knowledge_vaults:
  # Local knowledge vaults — directories containing markdown intelligence files
  # These are auto-discovered from VAULT_KNOWLEDGE_PATH but can also be listed explicitly
  - name: defi_intelligence
    path: /vault/knowledge_vaults/defi_intelligence   # local path to vault dir
    type: knowledge
    description: "DeFi Intelligence — TVL, governance, rates, Aave/Compound/Uniswap"

  - name: ai_intelligence
    path: /vault/knowledge_vaults/ai_intelligence
    type: knowledge
    description: "AI Model Intelligence — benchmarks, pricing, releases"

  # Custom shared vault — e.g. your team's research
  # - name: team_research
  #   path: /shared/team-vault
  #   type: shared
  #   description: "Team research notes"


  # Remote vault (v1.1) — query another vault node over HTTP
  # The remote vault must also be running vault_server.py
  # You need a subscriber token from the remote vault operator
  # - name: partner_defi_vault
  #   url: http://partner.example.com:8766
  #   token: vtok_subscriber_token_from_remote_operator
  #   type: remote_vault
  #   description: "Partner DeFi node — TVL, governance, yields"
# Notes:
# - personal vault memory stays private, never shared
# - knowledge vaults are read-only (subscriber access)
# - vault.query() checks personal → knowledge_vaults → VINN network in order
# - personal vault always wins on conflicting data
# - conflicts surfaced in also_found[] with source attribution
# - remote HTTP vault querying: planned for v1.1
